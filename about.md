I am a MS student in Computer Science at Seoul National university supervised by Prof. Chongkwon Kim. I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Handong Global University, Korea.

My research interests are analysis of social network and recommender systems. I want to study more about Deep learning for these. 

Apart from all this, I love music, travelling and reading.

<p>I am a member of <a href="http://popeye.snu.ac.kr/"> SCONE Lab</a> . I study about Social Network and recommender system. 
    Brief explanation of these projects are given below.

</p>
<h2> Social Network Analysis:</h2>

<p>   
Social network analysis (SNA) is a strategy for investigating social structures through the use of network and graph theories. 
    I analyze various aspects of social structures to extract useful information. 
    Specially, I am focusing on analyzing network information diffusion and cascades, mechanism design for network influence maximization.

<h2>Recommender systems:</h2>

<p>
    Recommender Systems (RSs) are software tools and techniques providing suggestions for items to be of use to a user. 
    Traditional recommender systems always ignore social relationships among users.
    We tend to ask our friends for recommendations in our daily life, such as digital product buying or touching movies seeing. 
    Therefore, in order to improve recommender systems and to provide more personalized recommendation results, we need to incorporate social network information among users.
